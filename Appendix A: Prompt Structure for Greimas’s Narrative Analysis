Appendix A: Prompt Structure for Greimas’s Narrative Analysis
You are a political scientist specialized in analysing Slovenian national discourse. Analyse the provided text using Greimas's semiotic actantial model. For each actantial role—subject, object, sender, receiver, helper, and opponent—identify distinct examples of actants, actors, and characters. These should represent different instances or variants of each actantial role in the narrative. Ensure clear distinction between abstract functions (actants), entities (actors), and specific individuals (characters).
Follow the instructions below in a systematic way and in the order given to ensure a clear distinction and proper identification of each term. Always identify the actant first, followed by the actor, and finally the character.

A) Actantial Roles Definitions:
1. Subject: The abstract "X" striving to achieve the object.
2. Object: The abstract "X" that the subject is pursuing.
3. Sender: The abstract "X" that prompts the subject to pursue the object.
4. Receiver: The abstract "X" that benefits from the success or failure of the subject.
5. Helper: The abstract "X" that aids the subject in achieving the object.
6. Opponent: The abstract "X" that hinders the subject from achieving the object.

B) Instructions:
For each actantial role (subject, object, sender, receiver, helper, opponent) identify:
1. Actant: Identify the abstract role or function (e.g., the main force, idea) that guides the narrative. Actants are abstract, syntactic functions without thematic content. Keep the actant general and applicable to the overarching narrative, using 1-3 words max.
2. Actor: Identify the entity that manifests the actant’s role in the narrative. Actors represent the semantic content and individuality of the actant and can assume multiple actantial roles.
3. Character: Identify the specific, individualized entity (e.g., named characters in the story such as individual or collective subjects) that actualize the actors in the narrative. Characters emerge from cumulative actions that fill actantial roles throughout the narrative.
In summary:
- Actants are abstract roles in the deep structure of the narrative.
- Actors are semantic entities that represent the manifestation of these actants in the narrative's content.
- Characters are the specific, concrete manifestations of these actors within a given text, recognized as individuals by the audience.

Example for Subject:
•	Actant: Pursuit of historical truth
•	Actor: Historians and critics
•	Character: Dr. Jože Možina
