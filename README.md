This repository contains a fully automated Google Colab implementation of a computational framework for analyzing cultural memory discourse. The approach leverages GPT-4o, NLP embedding techniques, and clustering algorithms to assess narrative structures in news and social media.

## **Overview**
This project investigates how **commemorative narratives** evolve in **social media vs. traditional media**, focusing on **deliberative discourse quality**. The methodology applies:
- **Greimas' Narrative Analysis**: Identifying core narrative roles (**Subject, Object, Sender, Receiver, Helper, Opponent**).
- **Antagonism-Agonism-Deliberation (AAD) Scoring**: Measuring discourse tension.
- **Discourse Function Analysis**: Assessing epistemic, ethical, ideological, and democratic aspects.
- **Embedding Clustering and Multiple Factor Analysis**: Using **MFA + HDBSCAN** to identify patterns in narratives.

The pipeline is designed for **Colab execution**, ensuring accessibility without requiring local installations.
